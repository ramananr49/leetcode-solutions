# Python LeetCode Solutions 🐍

This folder contains Python implementations of LeetCode problems.

## Structure

- Each file represents a single LeetCode problem:
<problem_number>_<problem_title>.py

- Example:
0001_two_sum.py
0002_add_two_numbers.py


## Conventions

- Clear, readable code
- Comments at the top explaining:
- Problem description (short)
- Approach / Pattern
- Time & Space complexity
- Follow consistent file naming: `<problem_number>_<snake_case_problem_title>.py`

## Notes

- Implement problems in multiple languages for comparison
- Focus on **clarity, learning, and pattern understanding**
