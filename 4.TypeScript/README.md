## Structure

- Each file represents a single LeetCode problem:
<problem_number>_<problem_title>.ts

- Example:

0002_add_two_numbers.ts


## Conventions

- Clear, readable code
- Comments at the top explaining:
- Problem description (short)
- Approach / Pattern
- Time & Space complexity
- Follow consistent file naming: `<problem_number>_<snake_case_problem_title>.ts`

## Notes
